# Pinewood Derby Race Timer 

The PDT timer is an Arduino based race timer with a robust and flexible design which allows it to be easily constructed and modified to meet your specific needs. Features of the race timer include:

- Easily expandable from 1 to 6 lanes
- Supports (optional) solenoid start gate circuit
- Supports (optional) lane place/time digital displays
- Works standalone or can be interfaced to software running on a PC
- Supports lane masking, start gate status check, force end of race

Interfacing the race timer to software running on a computer (Windows, Mac or Linux) allows races to be managed and allows you to record and archive car run times as you test and tune your Pinewood Derby car(s).  The race timer is currently compatible with the following software:

- Free PD Test/Tune/Track (PDT3) software utility (Windows only)
- The popular Grand Prix Race Manager software (Windows, Mac)
- Pinewood Master software (Mac only)
- DerbyNet software (Windows, Mac or Linux)
